# Diatomic Simulator

## Description

This program simulates the rotational spectrum of diatomic molecules using Rust. 
It utilizes quantum mechanical principles to calculate the energy levels and corresponding spectral lines of the molecule under consideration.

## Progress

- now: 
    - logic part(calculation of the spectrum from rotational constant and other parameters)
    - GUI part(plot by default paremeter) 
- upcomming: GUI part(It is implemented by GTK+ toolkit.)

## Features

- Calculates rotational energy levels
- Generates rotational spectrum
- Allows customization of molecule parameters (rotational constant, rotational temperature, band origin)
